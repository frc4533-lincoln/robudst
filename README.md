# RobuDSt

FRC driver station implementation in Rust

---

Our goal is to make it so lightweight and performant it can comfortably run on a microcontroller, such as the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

While that part's mainly meant to be as a toy, we're building strong integrations with Rust's excellent ecosystem to make RobuDSt more robust than the official driver station.

While RobuDSt will likely never be allowed in a competition, we're hoping to show
